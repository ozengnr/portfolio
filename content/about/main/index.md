  I'm a business intelligence analyst at [The Predictive Index](https://www.predictiveindex.com/) and I'm working on constructing a product-led funnel for our [talent optimization suite.](https://www.predictiveindex.com/software/hiring/) My original name is `Mustafa Özen Güner` but it's hard to pronounce for many folks, so I go with `Oz Guner` which has a funny story for another day. It's pronounced *`oz-gue-naire`* rather than *`gunner`*. 

  I studied International Relations & American History at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. I've been living in the U.S. since 2017 and I've recently become a naturalized citizen. I have since changed professions and took up what I've loved all along - numbers and quantitative analysis. 
  
  I live in Watertown, MA with my wife, Cansu.
